[ ] fix autocomplete backends
[ ] more git integrations
[ ] LLM plugin. (chat would be enough? maybe just a CLI binary + toggle term?)
[ ] add more git commands to legendary
[ ] add more lsp/refactoring commands to legendary
[ ] disable/find better file managers (added zoxide, should be OK to just use it and have something like nvim-tree as a backup. So I need to disable auto-tree on open)
